## Lab Overview

In this lab you will learn how to utilize Instana’s Application Perspective using your custom tags and zones. The Application Perspective (AP) auto-generates a feature rich monitoring dashboard where users can stay focused on the services they are interested in and not be distracted. AP’s can be customizable by technology, zone/cluster, version/release, and more. Alerts, errors, and logs are scoped to an AP to focus the troubleshooting.

## Step 1:

Click on the STAN icon
